# Project Name
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## General Information

- Business problem - You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
As per our final Model, the top 3 predictor variables that influences the bike booking are:

- Temperature (temp)it increase in temp variable increases the bike hire numbits.
- Weather Situation 3 (weathersit_3 nit increase in Weathersit3 variable decreases the bike hire numits.
- Year - increase in yr variable increases the bike hire units.
So, it's suggested to consider these variables utmost importance while planning, to achive maximum Booking

The next best features that can also be considered are

season winter , weather situation while rains and month sept
